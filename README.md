# shell-Scripting-Control-Flow
## This project will demonstrate the use of control flows in shell scripts to perform tasks

## Control flow
Control flow in shell scripting allows you to direct the execution path of your script based on conditions, loops, and pattern matching. Let me explain each construct with practical examples and then create the script you requested.

### If-Else Statements.
* The if-else construct allows conditional execution based on test conditions.

* Create a script named control_flow.sh. Run `nano control_flow.sh`

* Add the line below to the script and save.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a number: " num 
```

* List the working directory to see script file permision. Run `chmod +x control_flow.sh` to add execute right to user.
